--you need all three parameters that LAG accepts in order to look to the previous row and never return a null--
--Scalar_expression: We define a column name or expression in this argument. The lag function does calculations on this column. It is a mandatory argument, and we cannot execute the lag function without this
--Offset: We define an integer number in this argument. The lag function uses this argument forgo behind the number of rows (offset). The default value for this argument is one. It is an optional argument
--Default: Suppose we define an offset, value that does not lie in the boundary of the data. For example, we specified offset value 3 for the first row. A lag function cannot go three rows behind. It displays the default value if specified. If we do not specify any value for this, the lag function displays NULL in the output for out of range values--
